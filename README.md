# The Plunge

## Description
This application is a turn-based combat game built using REACT. The user controlls three characters to fight a set of ten battles with different opponents for each encounter, each with their own skills and abilities. The three characters level up over the course of the game depending on how much time they spend against each enemy, allowing the user to customize their gameplay experience. Lastly, if a player fails at a given floor, their characters are preserved and they can reattempt the stage.

Future plans:

MVP3:
- Add spam protection to the game
- Add field effects to each stage
- Add additonal character options, and allow user to pick 3 of the characters to go through the game
- Add sfx to the battle
- Add some way of storing current levels even if user logs out
- Add superboss

MVP4:
- Add an arcade mode
- Add some sort of scoring mechanic to the games
