# The Plunge

## Description
This application is a turn-based combat game built using REACT. The user controlls three characters to fight an enemy. Currrently, only one stage has been written, but the combat is fully functional. 

Future plans:

MVP2:
- Add 9 more stages for a total of 10 enemies. 2 Stages have already been written to work in CLI but not ported to the application yet.
- Add a levelling mechanic for users to customize their characters as they play through the stages
- Add functionality to allow players to pick which character they want to start the battle with
- Fix the display of damage/stats to be all at 2 d.p.

MVP3:
- Add field effects to each stage
- Add additonal character options, and allow user to pick 3 of the characters to go through the game
- Add sprites/sfx to the battle

MVP4:
- Add an arcade mode
- Add some sort of scoring mechanic to the games
